# CI/CD test project

### Notes:

- created .github folder and inside a .workflows folder.
- created a simple yaml file inside .workflows (whatever.yml) and added a simple workflow.
- GitHub's site Actions section helps to create workflows as well.
- YAML files accuracy be checked online with some free syntax validators (e.g. [YAML Lint](http://www.yamllint.com/))
