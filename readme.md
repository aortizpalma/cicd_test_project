# CI/CD test project

### Notes:

- created `.github` folder and inside a `workflows` folder.
- created a simple yaml file inside `workflows` (whatever.yml) and added a simple workflow. The yaml file name is usually associated with the branch or the repo name (e.g. _main.yml, my-repo-pipeline.yml_).
- GitHub's site Actions section helps to create workflows as well.
- YAML files accuracy be checked online with some free syntax validators (e.g. [YAML Validator](https://jsonformatter.org/yaml-validator) and [YAML Lint](http://www.yamllint.com/))
- Added a _worflow status badget_. This can be easily added to the README file by copy/pasting the code from the Actions page, using the 3-dots menu on the right side of the workflows.
